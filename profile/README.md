# LMD Doctorate Progress Manager

## Description
LMD Doctorate Progress Manager is a web application designed for managing the progress of a competition for the 3rd cycle LMD doctorate of the University of Constantine 2, from the application to the display of the final results.

This application allows candidates accepted by the website of the Ministry of Higher Education Progress to consult all information shared by the Vice-Dean. It also allows the Vice-Dean to share the necessary information on the progress of the competition and to generate codes for the preservation of the anonymity of the candidates present during the competition.

The application must allow the president of the CFD to assign a set of teachers for the correction of the copies of the candidates' exams. Each copy is corrected by two teachers, and if the difference between the two marks is greater than or equal to 3 points, the president of the CFD must assign a third teacher to correct this paper. The final mark of this paper is the average between the two marks that are greater and closer. Otherwise, if the difference between the two marks given by the two teachers is less than 3 points, the final grade for this paper is the average of the two grades. The system must calculate the final average of each candidate anonymously, and the president of the CFD is responsible for displaying the list of candidates with their final averages (with the possibility of displaying the scores in detail for each candidate).

Each teacher chosen to correct the copies must have a note entry space that only he can access, and he then sends these notes to the president of the CFD.
